      <h2>🌸 Our Story</h2>
      <p>Money Solutions was born from a deep passion to empower women through financial knowledge, digital skills, and entrepreneurship. Founded by Phindile Mlilwana — a seasoned Avon representative, digital product creator, and graduate of the FNB App Academy — this brand is a reflection of real hustle, resilience, and a desire to help others build wealth the smart way.

After more than 8 years of working in direct selling and seeing the everyday struggles that reps, freelancers, and small business owners face — from inconsistent income to lack of guidance — Phindile knew it was time to create solutions. Practical ones. Digital ones. Money-making ones.

And so, Money Solutions was born: a brand created for the woman who wants more. More clarity. More income. More confidence. More freedom.</p>
