      <h2>🌸 Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Money Solutions was born from a deep passion to empower women through financial knowledge, digital skills, and entrepreneurship. 
        Founded by Phindilemaria Mlilwana — a seasoned Avon representative, digital product creator, and graduate of the FNB App Academy — 
        this brand is a reflection of real hustle, resilience, and a desire to help others build wealth the smart way.
      </p>
      <p>
        After more than 8 years in direct selling and seeing the everyday struggles that reps, freelancers, and small business owners face — 
        from inconsistent income to lack of guidance — Phindile knew it was time to create practical, digital, money-making solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so, Money Solutions was born: a brand created for the woman who wants more. More clarity. More income. More confidence. More freedom.
